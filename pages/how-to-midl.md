## Program

We set up a nice little program in our well-known virtual conference center in Gather.Town, with a strong focus on getting to know your fellows and making you feel well-prepared for your in-person MIDL experience.

How does a poster session work without breakout rooms? How do I approach this speaker after the super-interesting presentation? Is it already appropriate to grab a coffee? Should I wear my best suit or my lovely worn-out Nirvana shirt? And what happens after the last session?
Don't worry, we will prepare you well! The event starts with a short course "How to MIDL - 101", teaching the basics about in-person conferences.
