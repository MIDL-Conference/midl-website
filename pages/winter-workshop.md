# MIDL Winter Workshop 2021

The MIDL Foundation is proud to present the launch of its first independant online event series: The MIDL Winter Workshop!

One thing the pandemic taught us is that even though a virtual event cannot substitute a live conference experience, it can be an easy and comfortable way to bring the community together on a more regular basis. So here it is: The winter event to come together in early December to discuss our ideas before submitting them to MIDL 2022.

The Winter Workshop 2021 will take place at 01.12.2021 as a virtual event using Gather.Town. It will be divided into two workshop tracks that run in parallel followed by the „Glühwein-Lecture“ and get together. While the latter part is open to the whole community, the workshops are specifically designed to support young researchers in taking their first steps towards authoring a publication or serving as a reviewer.
Thanks to our sponsor Fraunhofer IMTE, the event will be free of charge. however, a mandatory registration is necessary.

Please note that a registration for one of the workshops (see link below) includes participation in the Glühwein-Lecture, so no additional registration is necessary. If you just want to attend the Glühwein-Lecture and the get together, please register independently [here EXCHANGE LINK]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein").

## Workshops

One core part of the Winter Workshop is to support young researchers in taking their first steps towards authoring a publication or serving as a reviewer. Therefore, the event hosts two workshop tracks that will be run in parallel, namely „How to write an award-winning paper“ and „How to write an outstanding review“. Both workshops will feature an introductory tutorial and an intense hands-on session in small groups, guided by an experienced moderator. Due to the strategic date of the Winter Workshop, the participants will be directly prepared to submit to or review for MIDL 2022.

### How to write an award-winning paper ![Portrait of Hoel Kervadec](/images/pic_hoel.jpg){:style="float:right", width="180" }

You want to submit your research to MIDL 2022 but you have troubles putting it all together on 8 pages? You do not have a lot of experience with writing papers or you just want to impress the reviewers with your next submission? Join this workshop to learn how to make your paper award-winning!
After a tutorial full of valuable hints, dos and don’ts, there will be an intense hands-on session in smaller groups, guided by an experienced moderator. In this session, you will discuss and fine-tune your own manuscript. So, if you are planning to submit to MIDL 2022, bring your first draft and go out with a substantially revised version.
