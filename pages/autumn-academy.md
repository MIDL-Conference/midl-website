We proudly present the first edition of the next regular online event in the annual calender of MIDL: The Autumn Academy!
And for this first edition, we chose one of the most important and similarly one of the most under-represented research skills to train: Reproducibility!

## How to make your research reproducible? ![Portrait of Attila Simko](/images/winter-workshop/pic_tingting.jpg){: class="align-right" width="180" }

The Glühwein-Lecture is an honorary keynote to get broader perspectives and novel insights from leading figures in the healthcare technology domain.
We are happy to announce that this year's Glühwein-Lecture will be held by [Dr. Tingting Zhu](https://eng.ox.ac.uk/people/tingting-zhu/) from the University of Oxford. The topic of the talk will be „Healthcare Technology in Resource-Constrained Settings“.

Following the lecture, there will be a virtual get-together. Everyone is encouraged to prepare [Glühwein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mulled_wine) or non-alcoholic [Punsch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punch_(drink)) on their own, you can find recipes below.

## Workshops

One core part of the Winter Workshop is to support young researchers in taking their first steps towards authoring a publication or serving as a reviewer. Therefore, the event hosts two workshop tracks that will be run in parallel, namely „How to write an award-winning paper“ and „How to write an outstanding review“. Both workshops will feature an introductory tutorial and an intense hands-on session in small groups, guided by an experienced moderator. Due to the strategic date of the Winter Workshop, the participants will be directly prepared to submit to or review for MIDL 2022.

### How to write an award-winning paper ![Portrait of Hoel Kervadec](/images/winter-workshop/pic_hoel.jpg){: class="align-right" width="180" }

You want to submit your research to MIDL 2022, but you have troubles putting it all together on 8 pages? You do not have a lot of experience with writing papers, or you just want to impress the reviewers with your next submission? Join this workshop to learn how to make your paper award-winning!
After a tutorial full of valuable hints, dos and don’ts, there will be an intense hands-on session in smaller groups, guided by an experienced moderator. In this session, you will discuss and fine-tune your own manuscript. So if you are planning to submit to MIDL 2022, bring your first draft and go out with a substantially revised version.
We are happy that the workshop will be led by [Dr. Hoel Kervadec](https://hoel.kervadec.science) from Erasmus MC. He will be supported by [Annika Reinke](https://www.dkfz.de/en/cami/team/people/Annika_Reinke.html), [Steffen Czolbe](https://di.ku.dk/english/staff/?pure=en%2Fpersons%2Fsteffen-czolbe(1767ec13-391b-470d-aab8-5b0b8c802cc0)%2Fpublications.html), [Hristina Uzunova](https://www.imi.uni-luebeck.de/institut/mitarbeiter/uzunova-hristina.html), [Dr. David Kohan Marzagão](https://kohan.uk) and [Dr. Nikolas Lessmann](https://www.diagnijmegen.nl/people/nikolas-lessmann/).

All available places for this workshop are booked. However, feel free to register for the Glühwein-Lecture.


### How to write an outstanding review ![Portrait of Ender Konukoglu](/images/winter-workshop/pic_ender.jpg){: class="align-right" width="180" }

You were invited to review for MIDL 2022, for another venue or even a journal? You want to take your first steps in writing reviews independently, or you just want t become more efficient in doing so? Join this workshop to learn how to write outstanding reviews.
After a tutorial loaded with hints from experienced, senior colleagues, you will discuss and improve your very own reviews in small groups. You will learn how to open up your own mind to grasp a manuscript from different perspectives, and you will rate exemplary reviews.
We are proud that the workshop will be led by [Prof. Dr. Ender Konukoglu](http://people.ee.ethz.ch/~kender/) from ETH Zürich. He will be supported by [Prof. Dr. Mattias Heinrich](https://www.imi.uni-luebeck.de/institut/mitarbeiter/heinrich-mattias.html) and [Prof. Dr. Maria Vakalopoulou](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/en/msc-artificial-intelligence-faculty).

All available places for this workshop are booked. However, feel free to register for the Glühwein-Lecture.
