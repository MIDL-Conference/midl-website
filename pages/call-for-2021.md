title: Call for MIDL 2021

## Financial details

The first editions of MIDL were organized with support of local institutions, and local funds from the organizers and
the small profits from previous editions were used for upfront payments for venue/gala dinner. If MIDL does not grow much
it should be possible to stick to this way of organizing the conference. An alternative, and probably a necessity if MIDL
grows, is to use a company that supports the organization of MIDL and takes financial risks. We are likely able to provide
support from such a company and hope to provide details at MIDL 2019. For now, it would be good to indicate in the bid
a tentative budget and possibilities to take local responsibility for upfront payments for scenarios from 300 to 1200
participants.
