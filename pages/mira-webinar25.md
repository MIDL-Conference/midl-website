The development of machine learning methods and applications for medical imaging has evolved over the years. However, most developments have been targeted to high-income settings, limiting the advancement of healthcare solutions in low-to-middle-income countries. To bridge this gap, it is important to raise awareness to promote the development of accessible machine learning solutions for healthcare in low to middle income countries.
