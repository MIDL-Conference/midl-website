## BOARD MEETINGS
### Article 6.
1. The board shall meet at least once a year and furthermore as often as the chairman or another board member deems appropriate. Notice of a meeting shall be given in writing, e.g. by e-mail, at least seven days in advance - not counting the date of the convocation and the date of the meeting - stating the place of the meeting and the items to be discussed. Attendance at the meeting by telephone is possible.
2. If the meeting is not convened in writing or if subjects are discussed that were not mentioned in the convocation, or if the convocation is convened within a period of less than seven days, a valid decision of the board is nevertheless possible, provided that all board members are present at the meeting in question and that no members of the board oppose the decision-making process.
3. The board meetings shall be chaired by the chairman and, in his absence, by another board member to be appointed by the meeting. Valid decisions can only be taken if at least half of the board members in office are present or represented.

A suspended board member shall have access to the meeting at which the lifting or extension of his suspension is decided. If a resolution to suspend or dismiss a member of the board is on the agenda, the person concerned will be heard and may be assisted in this by a legal counsel.

Unless otherwise provided in these Articles of Association, resolutions of the board shall be passed by an absolute majority of the votes cast at the meeting. Blank votes shall be deemed not to have been cast. In the event of a tie, the proposal will be raised again at a subsequent meeting. If the votes are again tied, the proposal is rejected. The chairman of the meeting determines the method of voting.
2. Resolutions of the board may be made without holding a meeting, provided that all the members of the board are given the opportunity to vote and all of them have declared in writing that they do not object to this method of decision-making. A decision will then be taken as soon as the required majority of all board members have declared in writing that they support the proposal.

## FINANCIAL YEAR AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
### Article 8.
1. The foundation's financial year coincides with the calendar year.
2. The board is obliged to keep such records concerning the state of the foundation's assets and liabilities and all matters relating to its activities, that the rights and obligations of the foundation can be known at any time.

Adoption by the Board of the documents designed by the Treasurer shall discharge the Treasurer.

1. The Board is authorised to decide to amend the articles of association.
2. A resolution of the board to amend the articles of association requires a majority of two-thirds of the votes cast at a meeting at which all directors in office are present or represented. If a meeting at which a proposal to amend the articles of association is on the agenda is not complete, a second meeting shall be convened, to be held no earlier than two weeks and no later than four weeks after the first meeting. At this second meeting, irrespective of the number of current or represented board members, a valid resolution can be passed on the proposal as it was discussed at the first meeting, provided that it is passed by a two-thirds majority of the votes cast.
3. A copy of the proposal, containing the verbatim text of the proposed amendment, must be attached to the notice convening the meeting at which an amendment to the articles of association is to be proposed.
