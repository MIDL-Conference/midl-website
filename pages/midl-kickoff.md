<h1 style="font-size: 30px; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 24px">How to MIDL - The virtual Pre-Conference Bootcamp</h1>


You are attending your first MIDL? Maybe it is your first in-person conference or even your first conference at all? 
Or, after long years of virtual events, do you feel like your social skills might need polishing before joining the MIDL-crowd in person again?
Here is the perfect event for you to kick off your conference experience!

Whether you are new to the community and don't want to go to the Zürich alone or you are a MIDL veteran who cannot wait to see your peers again to push your excitement for Switzerland: Meet up with fellow young researchers from all over the world who are going to attend MIDL 2022 in person just before you head off to Zürich.

The event will take place on **29 June 2022** as a **virtual event** via Gather.Town and addresses young researchers (in its broadest sense) that will attend MIDL 2022 in person.

## Program

We set up a nice little program in our well-known virtual conference center in Gather.Town, with a strong focus on getting to know your fellows and making you feel well-prepared for your in-person MIDL experience.

How does a poster session work without breakout rooms? How do I approach this speaker after the super-interesting presentation? Is it already appropriate to grab a coffee? Should I wear my best suit or my lovely worn-out Nirvana shirt? And what happens after the last session?
Don't worry, we will prepare you well! The event starts with a short course "How to MIDL - 101", teaching the basics about in-person conferences.
