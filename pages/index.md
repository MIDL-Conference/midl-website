## About MIDL

The aim of the International Conference on Medical Imaging with Deep Learning (MIDL) is to bring the community of deep learning and medical imaging researchers, clinicians and health-care companies together for in-depth discussion and exchange of ideas.

We are committed to openness and transparency. This includes an open review, open access for all papers presented at MIDL, transparency with regard to sponsorship packages and involvement from industry at the conference, freely available recordings of all presentations on a well maintained MIDL website, and open access policy as much as possible for data and code.
