Did you know that early career researchers experience anxiety and depression at rates over six times higher than the general population? [1] These numbers highlight just how critical it is to address mental health in academia. By raising awareness and fostering open conversations, we can help break the stigma surrounding mental health.

We are excited to welcome Dr. Sophie Valeix who facilitates PhD workshops on mental health as part of the Doctoral School's Researcher Development Programme at the University of Sussex. She will talk about the latest research on mental health in early career researchers and share strategies to navigate wellbeing challenges commonly faced in academic environments.

This webinar is open to everyone, whether you're currently facing mental health challenges or simply interested in learning more. We believe all attendees will leave with meaningful insights on mental wellbeing.

The Seminar will take place on **16 July 2025, 15:00-17:00 UTC+0** as a virtual Zoom event.  The event will be free of charge. However, a mandatory registration is necessary and Zoom links will be sent out after registration.
