<h1 style="font-size: 30px; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 24px">YR Showcase Event 2025</h1>

The MIDL Young Researcher Board is happy to announce the first MIDL Young Researcher Showcase!

The MIDL Young Researcher (YR) Showcase is designed to be a premier event for young researchers within the MIDL community to showcase their work. The event aims to provide a space for Masters and PhD students to share their in-progress, preliminary or recently achieved results with others in the community. We are inviting abstracts from early career researchers in our community which will be judged by members of the MIDL YR board and, if accepted, invited for a presentation at an exciting online showcase event!

This is a great opportunity for early career researchers to gain experience in presenting their work. As an extra incentive, prizes will be awarded for outstanding abstracts and presentations!

The YR Showcase will take place on **10 September, 2025, 15:00-17:00 UTC+0** as a virtual Zoom event. If you wish to submit an abstract, please use the registration link below. Attendees not submitting an abstract are also encouraged to register to receive Zoom links for the event. The event will be free of charge.

The abstract submission deadline is **22 August, 01:00 UTC+0**.

After the showcase, all participants are welcome to stay on the Zoom link for a social gathering (if you so wish)! Please note that a detailed schedule will be amended at a later date.

**Scope**: Abstracts should be on topics under the general MIDL research themes and can reflect important recently published work, early stage projects, frameworks or applications, validation studies and any other interesting findings. Abstracts *will not be published* subsequently.

**Suggested Sections**: Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion

**Length**: No more than 400 words and max. one figure / table
