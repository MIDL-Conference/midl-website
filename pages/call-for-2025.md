# Call for organizers of MIDL 2025

The MIDL Board is inviting interested researchers to bid for organizing MIDL 2025 or a later edition. If we receive multiple strong bids, we may already decide on locations for MIDL in 2026 and beyond.

If you are interested in applying or have any questions, please contact us at [board@midl.io](mailto:board@midl.io)

## Financial details

All previous editions of MIDL were organized with support and financial guarantees of local institutions and local funds from the organizers. The MIDL Foundation can supply a loan to cover upfront costs, for, e.g., the venue or gala dinner. Please indicate in the bid a tentative budget and possibilities to take local financial responsibility for scenarios from 300 participants and beyond, and indicate the maximum possible number of particpants (typically determined by the capacity of the conference room at the venue, as MIDL is a single track conference).
