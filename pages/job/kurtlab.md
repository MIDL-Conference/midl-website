# Postdoc, 'Applications of AI/ML in neuroimaging'

Prof. Mehmet Kurt's research group at the University of Washington (Kurtlab) is recruiting a postdoctoral scholar in the field of applications of AI/ML in brain imaging. Our research program at Kurtlab combines motion-sensitive MRI-based neuroimaging techniques with machine learning and computational methods to study the human brain, with direct clinical applications in traumatic brain injury (TBI), Alzheimer's Disease, Chiari Malformation I, and intracranial aneurysms. Our research program is funded through multiple grants from NSF, NIH and DoD, and has been highlighted in national and international media. More information can be found at [www.kurtlab.com](https://www.kurtlab.com).  Interested candidates should contact me at [mkurt@uw.edu](mailto:mkurt@uw.edu) with their CVs.
